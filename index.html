I suffer from an excess of passion.
</p>
<p>
I am enrolled at the Startup Institute in Boston. I will be studying technical marketing. The Startup Institute represents an opportunity for me to expand my knowledge to have a greater impact at the company I join. It will also be an opportunity for me to grow my network and to hopefully, gain professional mentors. Moreover, I hope to gain a better understanding of my strengths and interests to better focus my energy.

In my free time I enjoy playing lacrosse. Since graduating I have participated in a number of tournaments. I plan to join a league in the Boston area.
